title: "D. Beautiful Permutation"

This is an interactive problem.

There is a permutationâˆ— $p$ of length $n$.

Someone secretly chose two integers $l,r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) and modified the permutation in the following way:

For every index $i$ such that $l \le i \le r$, set $p_i := p_i+1$.
Let $a$ denote the resulting array obtained by modifying the permutation.

You are given an integer $n$ denoting the length of the permutation $p$.

In one query, you are allowed to choose two integers $l,r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le n$) and ask for the sum of the subarray either of the original permutation $p[l \dots r]$ or of the modified array $a[l \dots r]$. The answer to such a query will be the corresponding integer sum.

Your task is to find the pair ($l,r$) that was chosen to obtain $a$ in no more than 40 queries.

## Solution

The core idea is to use binary search to find the boundaries of the modified segment $[l, r]$.

First, we can determine the length of the modified segment, which is $r - l + 1$. We can do this with two queries:
1.  Query the sum of the original permutation over the entire range $[1, n]$.
2.  Query the sum of the modified array over the entire range $[1, n]$.

The difference between these two sums will be exactly the length of the modified segment, because each element in the range $[l, r]$ was incremented by 1. Let's call this length `mod_len`.

Once we have `mod_len`, we need to find the left boundary, $l$. We can do this using binary search on the range $[1, n]$. For a given `mid`, we query the sum of the original and modified arrays in the range $[1, mid]$.

Let `diff = query(2, 1, mid) - query(1, 1, mid)`.
*   If `diff` is 0, it means the modified segment has not started yet, so the left boundary $l$ must be to the right of `mid`. We update our search range to `[mid + 1, high]`.
*   If `diff` is greater than 0, it means the modified segment has started at or before `mid`. So, `mid` is a potential candidate for $l$, and we should search for a smaller $l$ in the range `[low, mid - 1]`.

By repeatedly narrowing down the search space, we can find the smallest `mid` for which the difference is non-zero. This `mid` will be our left boundary, $l$.

Finally, the right boundary $r$ can be calculated as $l + mod_len - 1$.
