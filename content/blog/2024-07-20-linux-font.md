**Linux Fonts: Solving Display Issues**
=====================================

After installing Arch Linux, you may encounter issues with font rendering while using a web browser. Unfortunately, online search results from ChatGPT and Google might not provide an immediate solution.

Fortunately, installing the following fonts can generally resolve this problem:

* **ttf-font-awesome**: Provides icons and symbols
* **ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd**: A monospaced font with nerd font support
* **ttf-liberation**: A set of liberation fonts for improved rendering
* **ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols** and **ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-common**: Additional symbol fonts for enhanced display

Additionally, consider installing **wqy-microhei**, a popular Chinese font.

By installing these fonts, you should be able to resolve most font-related issues in your web browser on Arch Linux.
