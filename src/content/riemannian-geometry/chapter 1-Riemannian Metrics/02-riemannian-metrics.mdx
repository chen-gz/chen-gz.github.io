### 2.1 Definition _Riemannian Metric_

A _Riemannian metric_ (or _Riemannian structure_) on a differentiable manifold $M$ is a correspondence which associates to each point $p$ of $M$ an inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_p$ (that is, a symmetric, bilinear, positive-definite form) on the tangent space $T_p M$ , which varies differentiably in the following sense: If $\mathbf{x}: U \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to M$ is a system of coordinates around $p$ , with $\mathbf{x}(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) = q \in \mathbf{x}(U)$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}(q) = d\mathbf{x}_q(0, \dots, 1, \dots, 0)$ , then $\langle \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}(q), \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}(q) \rangle_q = g_{ij}(x_1, \dots, x_n)$ is a differentiable function on $U$ .

It is clear this definition does not depend on the choice of coordinate system.

Another way to express the differentiability of the Riemannian metric is to say that for any pair of vector fields $X$ and $Y$ , which are differentiable in a neighborhood $V$ of $M$ , the function $\langle X, Y \rangle$ is differentiable on $V$ . It is immediate that this definition is equivalent to the other.

It is usual to delete the index $p$ in the function $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_p$ whenever there is no possibility of confusion. The function $g_{ij}$ ( $= g_{ji}$ ) is called _the local representation of the Riemannian metric_ (or "the $g_{ij}$ of the metric") _in the coordinate system_ $\mathbf{x}: U \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to M$ . A differentiable manifold with a given Riemannian metric will be called a _Riemannian manifold_.

After introducing any type of mathematical structure, we must introduce a notion of when two objects are the same.

### 2.2 Definition _isometry_

Let $M$ and $N$ be Riemannian manifolds. A diffeomorphism $f: M \to N$ (that is, $f$ is a differentiable bijection with a differentiable inverse) is called an _isometry_ if:

$$
\quad \langle u, v \rangle_p = \langle df_p(u), df_p(v) \rangle_{f(p)}, \text{ for all } p \in M, u, v \in T_p M. \tag{1}
$$

### 2.3 Definition _local isometry_

Let $M$ and $N$ be Riemannian manifolds. A differentiable mapping $f: M \to N$ is a _local isometry_ at $p \in M$ if there is a neighborhood $U \subset M$ of $p$ such that $f: U \to f(U)$ is a diffeomorphism satisfying (1).

It is common to say that a Riemannian manifold $M$ is _locally isometric_ to a Riemannian manifold $N$ if for every $p$ in $M$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ in $M$ and a local isometry $f: U \to f(U) \subset N$ .

What follows are some non-trivial examples of the notion of Riemannian manifold.

### 2.4 Example _The almost trivial example._

$M = \mathbb{R}^n$ with $\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$ identified with $e_i = (0, \dots, 1, \dots, 0)$ . The metric is given by $\langle e_i, e_j \rangle = \delta_{ij}$ . $\mathbb{R}^n$ is called _Euclidean space of dimension $n$_ and the Riemannian geometry of this space is metric Euclidean geometry.

### 2.5 Example _Immersed manifolds_

Let $f: M^n \to N^{n+k}$ be an immersion, that is, $f$ is differentiable and $df_p: T_p M \to T_{f(p)} N$ is injective for all $p$ in $M$ . If $N$ has a Riemannian structure, $f$ induces a Riemannian structure on $M$ by defining $\langle u, v \rangle_p = \langle df_p(u), df_p(v) \rangle_{f(p)}$ , $u, v \in T_p M$ . Since $df_p$ is injective, $\langle, \rangle_p$ is positive definite. The other conditions of Definition 2.1 are easily verified. This metric on $M$ is then called the metric _induced_ by $f$ , and $f$ is an _isometric immersion_.

A particularly important case occurs when we have a differentiable function $h: M^{n+k} \to N^k$ and $q \in N$ is a regular value of $h$ (that is, $dh_p: T_p M \to T_{h(p)} N$ is surjective for all $p \in h^{-1}(q)$ ). It is known then that $h^{-1}(q) \subset M$ is a submanifold of $M$ of dimension $n$ ; hence, we can put a Riemannian metric on it induced by the inclusion.

For example, let $h: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be given by $h(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 - 1$ . Then 0 is a regular value of $h$ and $h^{-1}(0) = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n: x_1^2 + \dots + x_n^2 = 1\} = S^{n-1}$ is the _unit sphere_ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ . The metric induced from $\mathbb{R}^n$ on $S^{n-1}$ is called the _canonical metric_ of $S^{n-1}$ .

### 2.6 Examples _Lie groups._

A _Lie group_ is a group $G$ with a differentiable structure such that the mapping $G \times G \to G$ given by $(x, y) \to xy^{-1}$ , $x, y \in G$ , is differentiable. It follows then that _translations from the left_ $L_x$ and _translations from the right_ $R_x$ given by: $L_x: G \to G$ , $L_x(y) = xy$ ; $R_x: G \to G$ , $R_x(y) = yx$ are diffeomorphisms.

We say that a Riemannian metric on $G$ is _left invariant_ if $\langle u, v \rangle_y = \langle d(L_x)_y u, d(L_x)_y v \rangle_{L_x(y)}$ for all $x, y \in G$ , $u, v \in T_y G$ , that is, if $L_x$ is an isometry. Analogously, we can define a _right invariant Riemannian metric_. A Riemannian metric on $G$ which is both right and left invariant is said to be _bi-invariant_.

We say that a differentiable vector field $X$ on a Lie group $G$ is _left invariant_ if $dL_x X = X$ for all $x \in G$ . The left invariant vector fields are completely determined by their values at a single point of $G$ . This allows us to introduce an additional structure on the tangent space to the neutral element $e \in G$ in the following manner. To each vector $X_e \in T_e G$ we associate the left invariant $X$ defined by $X_a = dL_a X_e$ , $a \in G$ . Let $X, Y$ be left invariant vector fields on $G$ . Since for each $x \in G$ and for any differentiable function $f$ on $G,$

$$
\begin{aligned}dL_x[X, Y]f &= [X, Y](f \circ L_x) = X(dL_x Y)f - Y(dL_x X)f \\&= (XY - YX)f = [X, Y]f,\end{aligned}
$$

we conclude that the bracket of any two left invariant vector fields is again a left invariant vector field. If $X_e, Y_e \in T_e G$ , we put $[X_e, Y_e] = [X, Y]_e$ . With this operation, $T_e G$ is called the _Lie algebra_ of $G$ , denoted by $\mathcal{G}$ . From now on, the elements in the Lie algebra $\mathcal{G}$ will be thought of either as vectors in $T_e G$ or as left invariant vector fields on $G$ .

To introduce a left invariant metric on $G$ , take any arbitrary inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_e$ on $\mathcal{G}$ and define

$$
\quad \langle u, v \rangle_x = \langle (dL_{x^{-1}})_x(u), (dL_{x^{-1}})_x(v) \rangle_e, \quad x \in G, u, v \in T_x G. \tag{2}
$$

Since $L_x$ depends differentiably on $x$ , this construction actually produces a Riemannian metric, which is clearly left invariant.

In an analogous manner we can construct a right invariant metric on $G$ . If $G$ is compact, we will see in Exercise 7 that $G$ possesses a bi-invariant metric.

If $G$ has a bi-invariant metric, the inner product that the metric determines on $\mathcal{G}$ satisfies the following relation: For any $U, V, X \in \mathcal{G}$ ,

$$
\quad \langle [U, X], V \rangle = -\langle U, [V, X] \rangle. \tag{3}
$$

Before proving the relation above, we need some preliminary facts about Lie groups.

For any $a\in G$ , let $R_{a^{-1}}L_a:G\rightarrow G$ be the inner automorphism of $G$ determined by $a$ . Such a mapping is a diffeomorphism that keeps $e$ fixed. Thus, the differential $d(R_{a^{-1}}L_a)=Ad(a):\mathcal{G}\rightarrow\mathcal{G}$ is a linear map (in fact, it is a homomorphism of the Lie algebra, but we do not need this fact). Explicitly,

$$
Ad(a)Y=dR_{a^{-1}}dL_aY=dR_{a^{-1}}Y,\text{ for all }Y\in\mathcal{G}.
$$

Let $x_t$ be the flow of $X\in\mathcal{G}$ . Then, from Proposition 5.4 of Chapter 0,

$$
[Y,X]=\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{t}(dx_t(Y)-Y).
$$

On the other hand, since $X$ is left invariant, $L_y\circ x_t=x_t\circ L_y$ , giving

$$
x_t(y)=x_t(L_y(e))=L_y(x_t(e))=yx_t(e)=R_{x_t(e)}(y).
$$

Therefore, $dx_t=dR_{x_t(e)}$ , and

$$
[Y,X]=\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{t}(dR_{x_t(e)}(Y)-Y)=\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{t}(Ad(x_t^{-1}(e))Y-Y).
$$

Let us now return to the proof of (3). Let $\langle,\rangle$ be a bi-invariant metric on a Lie group $G$ . Then for any $X,U,V\in\mathcal{G}$ ,

$$
\langle U,V\rangle=\langle dR_{x_t(e)}\circ dL_{x_t^{-1}(e)}U,dR_{x_t(e)}\circ dL_{x_t^{-1}(e)}V\rangle=\\=\langle dR_{x_t(e)}U,dR_{x_t(e)}V\rangle.
$$

Differentiating the expression above with respect to $t$ , recalling that $\langle,\rangle$ is bilinear, and setting $t=0$ in the expression obtained, we conclude that

$$
0=\langle[U,X],V\rangle+\langle U,[V,X]\rangle,
$$

which is the equation (3).

The important point about the relation above is that it characterizes the bi-invariant metrics of $G$ , in the following sense. If a positive bilinear form $\langle,\rangle_e$ defined on $\mathcal{G}$ satisfies the relation (3), then the Riemannian metric defined on $G$ by (2) is bi-invariant. It is not difficult to prove this fact but we will not go into the proof here.

### 2.7 Example _Tensor Product Metric_

Let $M_1$ and $M_2$ be Riemannian manifolds and consider the cartesian product $M_1 \times M_2$ with the product structure. Let $\pi_1: M_1 \times M_2 \to M_1$ and $\pi_2: M_1 \times M_2 \to M_2$ be the natural projections. Introduce on $M_1 \times M_2$ a Riemannian metric as follows:

$$
\langle u, v \rangle_{(p,q)} = \langle d\pi_1 \cdot u, d\pi_1 \cdot v \rangle_p + \langle d\pi_2 \cdot u, d\pi_2 \cdot v \rangle_q,
$$

for all $(p,q) \in M_1 \times M_2$ , $u, v \in T_{(p,q)}(M_1 \times M_2)$ .

It is easy to verify that this is really a Riemannian metric on the product. For example, the torus $S^1 \times \cdots \times S^1 = T^n$ has a Riemannian structure obtained by choosing the induced Riemannian metric from $\mathbf{R}^2$ on the circle $S^1 \subset \mathbf{R}^2$ and then taking the product metric. The torus $T^n$ with this metric is called the _flat torus_.

We are now going to show how a Riemannian metric can be used to calculate the lengths of curves.

### 2.8 Definition _curve_

A differentiable mapping $c: I \to M$ of an open interval $I \subset \mathbf{R}$ into a differentiable manifold $M$ is called a (parametrized) _curve_.

Observe that a parametrized curve can admit self-intersections as well as "corners" (Fig. 1).

### 2.9 Definition

A _vector field $V$ along a curve $c: I \to M$_ is a differentiable mapping that associates to every $t \in I$ a tangent vector $V(t) \in T_{c(t)}M$ . To say that $V$ is _differentiable_ means that for any differentiable function $f$ on $M$ , the function $t \to V(t)f$ is a differentiable function on $I$ .

The vector field $dc(\frac{d}{dt})$ , denoted by $\frac{dc}{dt}$ , is called the _velocity field_ (or tangent vector field) of $c$ . Observe that a vector field along $c$ cannot necessarily be extended to a vector field on an open set of $M$ .

The restriction of a curve $c$ to a closed interval $[a, b] \subset I$ is called a _segment_. If $M$ is a Riemannian manifold, we define the length of a segment by

$$
\ell_a^b(c) = \int_a^b \left\langle \frac{dc}{dt}, \frac{dc}{dt} \right\rangle^{1/2} dt.
$$

Let us now prove a theorem on the existence of Riemannian metrics.

### 2.10 Proposition

A _differentiable manifold $M$ (Hausdorff with countable basis)_ has a Riemannian metric.

_Proof._ Let $\{f_\alpha\}$ be a differentiable partition of unity on $M$ subordinate to a covering $\{V_\alpha\}$ of $M$ by coordinate neighborhoods. This means (See Chap. 0, Sec. 5) that $\{V_\alpha\}$ is a locally finite covering (i.e., any point of $M$ has a neighborhood $U$ such that $U \cap V_\alpha \neq \emptyset$ at most for a finite number of indices) and $\{f_\alpha\}$ is a family of differentiable functions on $M$ satisfying:

1. $f_\alpha \ge 0$ , $f_\alpha = 0$ on the complement of the closed set $\overline{V_\alpha}$ .
2. $\sum_\alpha f_\alpha(p) = 1$ for all $p$ on $M$ .

It is clear that we can define a Riemannian metric $\langle, \rangle^\alpha$ on each $V_\alpha$ : the metric induced by the system of local coordinates. Let us then set $\langle u, v \rangle_p = \sum_\alpha f_\alpha(p) \langle u, v \rangle_p^\alpha$ for all $p \in M$ , $u, v \in T_p M$ . It is easy to verify that this construction defines a Riemannian metric on $M$ . $\square$

To conclude this chapter, we are going to show how a Riemannian metric permits us to define a notion of volume on a given oriented manifold $M^n$ .

As usual we need some preliminary facts. Let $p \in M$ and let $x: U \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to M$ be a parametrization
about $p$ which belongs to a family of parametrizations consistent with the orientation of $M$ (we say that such
parametrizations are positive). Consider a positive orthonormal basis $\{e_1, \dots, e_n\}$ of $T_p M$ and write
$X_i(p) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}(p)$ in the basis $\{e_i\}$ : $X_i(p) = \sum_{j} a_{ij} e_j$. Then

$$
g_{ik}(p) = \langle X_i, X_k \rangle (p) = \sum_{j\ell} a_{ij} a_{k\ell} \langle e_j, e_\ell \rangle = \sum_j a_{ij} a_{kj}.
$$

Since the volume $\text{vol}(X_1(p), \dots, X_n(p))$ of the parallelepiped formed by the vectors $X_1(p), \dots, X_n(p)$ in $T_p M$ is equal to $\text{vol}(e_1, \dots, e_n) = 1$ multiplied by the determinant of the matrix $(a_{ij})$ , we obtain

$$
\text{vol}(X_1(p), \dots, X_n(p)) = \det(a_{ij}) = \sqrt{\det(g_{ij})}(p).
$$

If $y: V \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to M$ is another positive parametrization about $p$ , with $Y_i(p) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y_i}(p)$ and $h_{ij}(p) = \langle Y_i, Y_j \rangle (p)$ , we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned} \quad \sqrt{\det(g_{ij})}(p) &= \text{vol}(X_1(p), \dots, X_n(p)) \\ &= J \text{vol}(Y_1(p), \dots,
Y_n(p)) = J \sqrt{\det(h_{ij})}(p), \end{aligned} \tag{4}
$$

where $J = \det(\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial y_j}) = \det(dy^{-1} \circ dx)(p) > 0$ is the determinant of the derivative of the change of coordinates.

Now let $R \subset M$ be a region (an open connected subset), whose closure is compact. We suppose that $R$ is contained in a coordinate neighborhood $x(U)$ with a positive parametrization $x: U \to M$ , and that the boundary of $x^{-1}(R) \subset U$ has measure zero in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (observe that the notion of measure zero in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is invariant by diffeomorphism). Let us define the _volume_ $\text{vol}(R)$ of $R$ by the integral in $\mathbb{R}^n$

$$
\quad \text{vol}(R) = \int_{x^{-1}(R)} \sqrt{\det(g_{ij})} dx_1 \dots dx_n. \tag{5}
$$

The expression above is well-defined. Indeed, if $R$ is contained in another coordinate neighborhood $y(V)$ with a positive parametrization $y: V \subset \mathbb{R}^n \to M$ , we obtain from the change of variable theorem for multiple integrals, (using the same notation as in (4),

$$
\int_{\mathbf{x}^{-1}(R)} \sqrt{\det(g_{ij})} dx_1 \dots dx_n = \int_{\mathbf{y}^{-1}(R)} \sqrt{\det h_{ij}} dy_1 \dots dy_n = \text{vol}(R),
$$

which proves that the definition given by (5) does not depend on the choice of the coordinate system (here the hypothesis of the orientability of $M$ enters by guaranteeing that $\text{vol}(R)$ does not change sign).

### 2.11 Remark

The reader familiar with differential forms will note that equation (4) implies that the integrand in the formula for the volume in expression (5) is a positive differential form of degree $n$ , which is usually called a _volume form_ (or _volume element_) $\nu$ on $M$ . In order to define the volume of a compact region $R$ , which is not contained in a coordinate neighborhood it is necessary to consider a partition of unity $\{\varphi_i\}$ subordinate to a (finite) covering of $R$ consisting of coordinate neighborhoods $\mathbf{x}(U_i)$ and to take

$$
\text{vol}(R) = \sum_i \int_{\mathbf{x}_i^{-1}(R)} \varphi_i \nu.
$$

It follows immediately that the expression above does not depend on the choice of the partition of unity.

### 2.12 Remark

It is clear that the existence of a globally defined positive differential form of degree $n$ (volume element) leads to a notion of volume on a differentiable manifold. A Riemannian metric is only one of the ways through which a volume element can be obtained.
