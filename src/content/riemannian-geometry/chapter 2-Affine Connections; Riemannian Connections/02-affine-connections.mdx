title: Affine Connections
---

Let us indicate by $\mathcal{X}(M)$ the set of all vector fields of class $C^\infty$ on $M$ and by $\mathcal{D}(M)$ the
ring of real-valued functions of class $C^\infty$ defined on $M$.

### 2.1 DEFINITION

An _affine connection_ $\nabla$ on a differentiable manifold $M$ is a mapping

$$ \nabla: \mathcal{X}(M) \times \mathcal{X}(M) \to \mathcal{X}(M) $$

which is denoted by $(X, Y) \xrightarrow{\nabla} \nabla_X Y$ and which satisfies the following properties :

1. $\nabla_{fX+gY} Z = f\nabla_X Z + g\nabla_Y Z$.  
2. $\nabla_X(Y+Z) = \nabla_X Y + \nabla_X Z$.
3. $\nabla_X(fY) = f\nabla_X Y + X(f)Y$,

in which $X, Y, Z \in \mathcal{X}(M)$ and $f, g \in \mathcal{D}(M)$.

This definition is not as transparent as that of Riemannian structure. The following proposition, nevertheless, should
clarify the situation a little.

### 2.2 PROPOSITION

Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold with an affine connection $\nabla$. There exists a unique correspondence which
associates to a vector field $V$ along the differentiable curve $c: I \to M$ another vector field $\frac{DV}{dt}$ along
$c$, called the covariant derivative of $V$ along $c$, such that:

1. $\frac{D}{dt}(V+W) = \frac{DV}{dt} + \frac{DW}{dt}$.
2. $\frac{D}{dt}(fV) = \frac{df}{dt}V + f\frac{DV}{dt}$, where $W$ is a vector field along $c$ and $f$ is a differentiable function on $I$.
3. If $V$ is induced by a vector field $Y \in \mathcal{X}(M)$, i.e., $V(t) = Y(c(t))$, then $\frac{DV}{dt} = \nabla_{dc/dt} Y$.

### 2.3 REMARK
The last line of (c) makes sense, since $\nabla_X Y(p)$ depends on the value of $X(p)$ and the value $Y$
along a curve, tangent to $X$ at $p$. In effect, part (iii) of Definition 2.1 allows us to show that the notion of
affine connection is actually a local notion (cf. Rem. 5.7 of Chap. 0). Choosing a system of coordinates $(x_1, \dots,
x_n)$ about $p$ and writing

$$ X = \sum_i x_i X_i, \quad Y = \sum_j y_j X_j, $$

where $X_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}$, we have

$$ \nabla_X Y = \sum_i x_i \nabla_{X_i} \left( \sum_j y_j X_j \right) = \sum_{ij} x_i y_j \nabla_{X_i} X_j + \sum_{ij}
x_i X_i(y_j) X_j.  $$
