The new post will be published both on this website and old [blog](https://blog.ggeta.com).
Previous posts can be found at [blog](https://blog.ggeta.com).

The blog at blog.ggeta.com is hosted on a personal server and is built with Go. It offers better support for mathematical expressions, although some features are still missing. Both blog systems will be synchronized. If you find that the mathematical expressions on this website are not satisfactory, you can visit blog.ggeta.com for a better experience.
