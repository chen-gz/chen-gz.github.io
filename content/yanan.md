## Work Experience

### Senior DS/MLE | Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, Arlington, VA | Aug 2021 - Present

**AI Selection Copilot & MLOps (BI Tool):**
- Initiated and led development of a GPT-4-based multi-agent AI Copilot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), automating mechanical audits and reducing engineering workload by 80%
- Wrote **production-grade ML pipelines** integrated with **CI/CD workflows**, deployed via **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for scalable and reproducible model deployment
- Developed **RESTful APIs** for low-latency **ML inference services**, enabling real-time engineering decisions with sub-second response time
- Implemented model versioning and monitoring using MLflow and Airflow, ensuring continuous delivery and rollback support in production
- Leveraged **LLM as an evaluator** to assess output accuracy and relevance, applying **conceptual fine-tuning** to improve robustness

**Anomaly/Fraud Detection:** Developed and deployed an **end-to-end XGBoost** to identify anomalies across 10 million HVAC ratings in real-time, reducing operating costs by $500,000 annually. Achieved a recall of 97% with precision of 85% and an F1-score of 90%, ensuring critical anomalies are captured.

**Cross-functional Collaboration:** Led cross-functional collaboration with engineers, legal, and policy teams, engaging with multiple stakeholders to ensure cohesive user experiences and industry compliance.

**Leadership:** Mentored multiple interns on project completion; Connected new hires with company culture.

### Research Assistant | Right Legal & University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada | Sep 2017 - May 2018

- Implemented a multi-label text classification system for historical legal documents, preprocessed featured words by **Word2Vec** to convert professional legal terms into plain language
- Built and deployed a **Transformer** based model achieving 94% accuracy and conducted sentiment analysis to enhance the website's matching algorithms, improving client-lawyer pairing efficiency

## Projects

### [Mock Interview AI Agent - LLM Agents Hackathon](https://github.com/Yanan-Gong/LLMisses-mock-interveiw-agent) | Python, Flask, AWS | Dec 2024

- Led, designed, and deployed a scalable AI-powered mock interview platform leveraging **GPT-4**, **RAG**, and **multi-agent architectures**. Delivered role-specific questions, industry-tailored scenarios, and real-time AI feedback, reducing user costs by 80%
- Implemented **Reasoning and Action** prompt engineering and LLM-based evaluations, deploying on **Kubernetes** with auto-scaling, supporting 1000 QPS and future scalability

### [Plot Tweaking Chatbot](https://github.com/Yanan-Gong/Plot_Chatbot_APP) | Python, Panel | Spring 2024

- Developed an AI-powered Matplotlib plot assistant integrating Mistral 8Ã—7B LLMs and Panel. Achieved 40% reduction in user visualization adjustment time and streamlined publication-ready visualization
