## NOTATION

### *Three-dimensional quantities*

Three-dimensional tensor indices are denoted by Greek letters

Element of volume, area and length:  $dV$ ,  $d\mathbf{f}$ ,  $d\mathbf{l}$

Momentum and energy of a particle:  $\mathbf{p}$  and  $\mathcal{E}$

Hamiltonian function:  $\mathcal{H}$

Scalar and vector potentials of the electromagnetic field:  $\phi$  and  $\mathbf{A}$

Electric and magnetic field intensities:  $\mathbf{E}$  and  $\mathbf{H}$

Charge and current density:  $\rho$  and  $\mathbf{j}$

Electric dipole moment:  $\mathbf{d}$

Magnetic dipole moment:  $\mathbf{m}$

### *Four-dimensional quantities*

Four-dimensional tensor indices are denoted by Latin letters  $i, k, l, \dots$  and take on the values
0, 1, 2, 3

We use the metric with signature  $(+---)$

Rule for raising and lowering indices—see p. 14

Components of four-vectors are enumerated in the form  $A^i = (A^0, \mathbf{A})$

Antisymmetric unit tensor of rank four is  $\epsilon^{iklm}$ , where  $\epsilon^{0123} = 1$  (for the definition, see p. 17)

Element of four-volume  $d\Omega = dx^0 dx^1 dx^2 dx^3$

Element of hypersurface  $dS^i$  (defined on pp. 20–21)

Radius four-vector:  $x^i = (ct, \mathbf{r})$

Velocity four-vector:  $u^i = dx^i/ds$

Momentum four-vector:  $p = (\mathcal{E}/c, \mathbf{p})$

Current four-vector:  $j^i = (c\rho, \rho\mathbf{v})$

Four-potential of the electromagnetic field:  $A^i = (\phi, \mathbf{A})$

Electromagnetic field four-tensor  $F_{ik} = \frac{\partial A_k}{\partial x^i} - \frac{\partial A_i}{\partial x^k}$  (for the relation of the components of

 $F_{ik}$  to the components of  $\mathbf{E}$  and  $\mathbf{H}$ , see p. 65)

Energy-momentum four-tensor  $T^{ik}$  (for the definition of its components, see p. 83)
