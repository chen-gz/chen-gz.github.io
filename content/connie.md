## Research Experience

### Research Assistant | *University of Pittsburgh* | *January 2021 - Present*

#### Programmable Pulse Generator for Pain Relief

- Designed a wearable Pulse Generator (PG) device for **analgesic nerve stimulation** using custom **ASIC**. The PG measures the impedance of the injected electrode and adjusts the current pulse to slow the degradation of the electrode.
- Designed a **current steering DAC** for current pulse generation. The DAC could generate **±4mA** current pulses with 15.6μA error and **linearity mismatch ≤1%**.
- Designed a **digital circuit system** for **SPI communication**. A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** is designed to decide PG work operation. 16 **internal registers**, each 8-bit wide, are used to store the pulse period.
- Implemented the PG using **TSMC 180nm** technology. Designed a **PCB** for PG using **Altium Designer**.
- The system peak power is **26.4mW**. A **vitro study** was conducted and the PG extends the electrode life from 30 hours to 80+ hours.

#### Bio-mimetic Neuron Network on Hardware with Coupled Rhythms

- Design and implement the **analog circuit** for a 5-neuron network with non-linear multi-timescale neuron model. Applied the network to **Central Pattern Generator (CPG)** to control robot.
- Constructed the neuron with a custom-designed **operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)** using **Cadence Virtuoso**. The Neuron network is verified in both **CALIBRE DRC** and **LVS**.
- The network was implemented on a 2mm × 1mm chip using **TSMC 180nm technology**. The chip is soldered on a custom **printed circuit board (PCB)**.
- Tested the neuron network chip with the **Verilog** program. Performed **post-layout extraction** and **verification** to ensure signal integrity in a multi-neuron network, achieving 200 -- 1000Hz spike frequencies. The waveform generated by inhibitory rhythm is applied to a dog robot and make it jump.

#### Nonlinear Mixed-feedback Neuron Chip Design and Test

- Architected and implemented a mixed-feedback **CMOS circuit** using **TSMC 180nm**.
- Tested the circuit with a custom-designed PCB. The chip is controlled by **FPGA development board**. The FPGA is programmed in **Xilinx Vivado** using **Verilog RTL** code.
- The tested neuron circuits generate **biomimetic behaviors** with powers of 31.4μW. It shows the potential of large integrated neuron network hardware.
