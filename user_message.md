I have applied the changes to `layouts/_partials/sidebar.html` to add the toggle button inside the sidebar.

Please follow the instructions in `conversation_summary.md` to clean up your git repository and commit the changes. After that, you can run `hugo server` to check if the button is now visible and functions as expected.

Let me know if you see the button and if it works correctly.
